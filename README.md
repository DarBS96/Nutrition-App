DI Hackathon 2 - Nutrition app 
In this project, we implemented a full-stack application using Node.js, express, and ejs while connecting to the client-side by fetching the data and using it on dynamic pages.
We have also used PostgreSQL to store the application's data.
The application's purpose is to give the user nutrition information regarding chosen foods based on API from Nutritionix.
