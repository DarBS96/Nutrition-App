DI Hackathon 2 - Nutrition app <br/>
In this project, we implemented a full-stack application using Node.js, express, and ejs while connecting to the client-side by fetching the data from the server and using it on dynamic pages. <br/>
We have also used PostgreSQL to store the application's data. <br/>
The application's purpose is to give the user nutrition information regarding chosen foods based on API from Nutritionix.
